# Vite environment variables for the To-Do List frontend

# API base used by the frontend to build request URLs.
# In development, using "/api" is recommended so that Vite can proxy to your backend.
# For production, set an absolute URL if your frontend is served from a different domain.
VITE_API_BASE=/api

# Development-only: target backend URL for the Vite dev server proxy.
# This enables calling "/api/*" from the frontend, and Vite forwards those requests to your backend.
# Example: if your backend runs at http://localhost:4000 and exposes /api/tasks, set:
# VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:4000
#
# If your backend DOES NOT use the "/api" prefix, you can edit vite.config.ts to use a rewrite
# that strips "/api".
VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET=http://localhost:4000
